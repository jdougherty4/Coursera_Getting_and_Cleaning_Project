# Coursera_Getting_and_Cleaning_Project

The goal of the analysis is to combine many files of unclean data and convert it into one tidy dataset. 
A tidy dataset is described as having each row represent a distinct observation, while each column is a distinct variable.

To do this, we use files from the UCI HAR dataset (files include features.txt, X_train.txt, X_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt)

The script loads in the data, add variables, filters the columns based on their names, and combines the training and testing datasets.
